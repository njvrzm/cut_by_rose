# Enumeration (but not with numbers). Also enomeration

Are the definite articles [significant / necessary / allowable]? They echo the tarot ("The Hermit" / "Justice"), which gives them credence. They feel fairly natural, in that most of the faces seem to obviously either warrant or not warrant a "the". Ah, but: those that do not _mostly_ involve an abstraction from the depiction. "imbalance", eg: this highlights an interpretation of the image, but the image (plainly) shows _scales_. The depicted scales are, granted, in a state of imbalance, and imbalance will doubtlessly be one of the facets of this face's elaboration, but ultimately to choose "imbalance" for the name of this face belies the [aim](aims.md) of directness.

Among these faces only a few seem certainly amenable to naming without article: fire; lightning; chaos; worry; sleep. Then again, that's most of the remaining ones.
