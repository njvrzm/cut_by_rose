# To name or to number

Numbering the cubes a) seems arbitrary, and b) imposes an order. Let's name the cubes instead. This will help both with avoiding linearity and (perhaps) remembering the faces.

A satisfactory [label / name / locus] for the constellation of faces can be found for each cube. (This is an axiom.) Finding a locus for each die is a significant part of the project.

I've started with numbers, but I will switch to names as I figure them out.
