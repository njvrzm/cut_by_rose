the sheep: implying a shepherd. "following the herd", domestication. providing wool. wandering. "sheep may safely graze". the shepherd is probably the pertinent image, although according to the aims we should be focusing on the actual image. So, the sheep: a grazer, a herd animal; going with the flow. 

the lock: secrets. keeping closed, hiding. protection? mostly secrets. a lock keeps out. a lock also keeps in, though. nothing would be locked if there were not two sides. associated with th ekey, obviously.

the footprint: passage. steps on a journey, but the journey is complete. the past leading to now. a reminder of the past. the foot: the foundation, interaction between body and ground. walking - steady progress towards a destination. the jesus story, of course. dinosaurs: relics. indication of...

the mark of the learner: a sign put on learning drivers, apparently. unfamiliar to me. but: the mark of the learner, specifically, that is, something that shows someone as being a beginner. hierarchy of knowledge; authority. learning, of course, but specifically learning in public to go along with the rules, hence the authority bit.

the magnet: attaction, as I wrote in my paper notes, but also discrimination: the magnet is not attracted to everything. some things it is repelled by, although that repulsion can always be turned to attraction with a little effort. binding but in a temporary way; holding in place conveniently.

fire / the phoenix: transformation, of course. fire. the release of stored energy, for a purpose or not. the light of the gods: inspiration. what was stolen and given. the source of warmth, power, safety; but also danger, destruction, loss. fire can consume.

---

the vector: direction, but more basically relationship. the purest form of relationship, where-in-relation-to. motion, drive, momentum, energy. force. purpose, aim. (or is that the other arrow?)

the scales: justice, of course. the scales are unbalanced, so: imbalance. value! something _being weighed_, hence consideration, judgment. (are judgment and justice related?) choice made - the deciding factor is present and has been realized, if not accepted. 

the alien: um, alienness? the unknown? what is not us. everything that is not us. the alienation of existence. awareness, and the burden thereof. something foreign. contact with something from outside one's comfort zone. probing. ufos. the promise of new wisdom.

lightning: inspiration, explosively rather than generatively (like fire). illumination, blinding and temporary. insight that does not remain but whose effects linger. punishment of the gods. fulfillment, completion of an ache or desire. exchange of energy.

the cane: support, tools used to support existence rather than to change. assistance in moving - aid on the journey. age? disability? not inherently, but both arise. gravitas. swords, hidden.

the phone: entanglement. communication. being reachable, reaching. the ever-evolving, unfolding, ramifying system of interconnection with others. acces to information. access to help. telepathy, magic.

---

the shadow: the distortion of projection. jungian: the underside of the thing. the small made large and scary by close illumination. the monster in the closet, the monster in the heart. the realness of the unreal, by perception.

the scarab: also just a beetle, but clicking into egyptian mythology as well. associated with the dead? eating the dead? dung beetles. I need to read more about this. Is it actually a scarab or just a regular beetle? beetles, that which god made so many of. small and hard, plodding, fierce, tough as hell. 

the hand: that by which we affect the world, change it, "mani"pulate it. power. craft. art. doing-to. an open hand: free giving, or requesting. the palm and what we read into it. high five. 

the turtle: on whose back the world rests. hard shell. seen as slow, plodding, but graceful and strong in the water. inhabiting multiple worlds. different adaptations to different environments. old. carrying its home.

the die: play, choice. structure. choices made discrete, choices made aleatorically. "the die is cast", but also "roll the dice". this system itself.

the magnifying glass: inspection, detail. making details more visible through technology: legibility enhancement. also concentrating light to make fire: focusing the sun's attention on a thing, so to speak. detective work, *seeing what has been missed*.

---

the tipi: shelter. making shelter from one's environment. making _space_, separating space. building. temporary retreat. movable space? nomadic but currently stationary.

the key: what opens. where there is blockage, opening. where there is closure, opening. where there is hiding, revealing. insight through work rather than inspiration. mechanised definiteness (in relation to the lock)

the fountain: welling up. bounty. (the fountain of youth.) turning water into art. water flows down, but the fountain makes it flow up as well. static motion, recirculation, the imitation of life?

the shooting star: _now_, the instant. an opportunity too brief to act on, that may only be witnessed. witnessing. an ancient history culminating in a moment. the end of the journey. death. the whole journey: life in a blink. (being consumed by what you do)

the question mark: uncertainty, the unknown, but the _known_ unknown? asking. seeking. having a shape to fill, looking to fill it. requesting, praying. answers, help, peace, justice, revenge...

worry: thinking about what may happen, thinking about being unhappy about what may happen. helplessness? yeah, this is not the worry of "this may not work" but the worry of "what will become of me?" Feeling subject to forces. 

---

the bridge: what may be burned, before or after you cross it. a channeling: tunneling through a barrier. choices limited, binarization. go over the bridge or no? but also: the water goes under the bridge, perpendicular. a different choice, a different path. work to get to a new space or go with the flow, forever between?

the moon: is it waxing or waning? no way to know. nearly full or nearly new. beginning of a new phase, or one winding down to its end. evening, morning. the march of time, circular cycles. cycles!

the abacus: numbers and the manipulation thereof. things abstracted into representations; moved as things to represent transformations as numbers. calculation, estimation, figuring. extending the brain into the world.

the magic wand: trickery? illusion? is it that kind of wand? or real magic? representation of the will; associated with the tarot wands, of course. sparkles. flashy. distraction while the "real" thing goes on? or - you have in your hands the tools to get what you want, you just have to commit your will?

the bee: "busy". stinging. honey - the stolen food of the gods, er, bugs. working together - communal but not mindless. colony. hive mind. dancing to share information. flowers, and the memory of flowers.

the book: the record of the transient; the linear-in-time made square-in-space. the voice. journals: writing one's own thoughts, but also seeking others'. narrative. (again, this system.) putting in order.

---

identification: authority, and buying into it, or succumbing to it. being part of society, provably. your name, your number, your weight, your address. identifying with labels, with what you are called, with how you are described (authority again, but ontological). the map is not the territory, but it does stand for it.

the fish: in water, out of water. who lives in the water. who moves by touching the environment, constantly. at home in its environment. mostly water too. strong, as cold or hot as what is around it. mating part of the water too.

the keyhole: absent the key and the lock - a window into secrets? looking through the keyhole. the key is not available. you have a sense of what is inaccessible, but no way to reach it - the keyhole is too small for anything but sight.

expansion / direction / eight-spoked-asterisk / out / oh right it's chaos: chaos, right, obviously. what can you say about it? anything you want! it'll even agree. and argue. and ignore you. all at the same time! or maybe it will surprise you...

the parachutist: trusting in preparation. but also: leaping from safety. ejection seat. last resort. but also doing terribly dangerous things for fun? doing the _impossible_ for fun. leap of faith (warranted).

thalia & melpomene: the masks, the twins. happy and sad. drama. feelings. but more: the representation of feelings, the deliberate conveyance of feelings - ones not actually felt. not a mockery of communication, although they can be used for mockery, but a form of communication that highlights the fact of communication. "I am putting on a sad mask", I say, "to show you that I am sad".

---

the apple: eris, natch, but also eve, and adam, and god, and the snake. johnny appleseed. the canonical fruit: something that provides some sustenance in exchange for distribution. favors. getting something you can't make yourself and giving something they can't.

the flashlight: attention, selective attention: lighting up what you want to see (or don't want to see). but what is being left in the dark? what are you missing by illuminating this small area? finding in the dark, but at the same time, _creating_ the dark, empowering the dark. you huddle around the light while the darkness grows around you.

the skyscraper: construction, reach, competition. proving wealth, proving skill, proving _better_. hives of activity. (the fall of the towers.) making tangible space where there was only visual space.

the world: another connection to the tarot. everything, but not really everything: everything you know. but everything you know seen from a distance, making it smaller, more connected. all in it together, everything we do touches. home, but _everyone's_ home.

content /optimism / happiness / openness: the opposite of worry (but not in every way): looking to the future with pleasure. confidence. not knowing but not in a problem way. or maybe just content: accepting the situation and focusing on the good.

the airplane: travel, fast and expensive and unpleasant but very fast. getting somewhere without doing anything: being carried. tunnels in the sky. going far. also the conquering of the possible with technology: heavier-than-air, but flying.

---

the lightbulb: inspiration. tapping into the power of society. extending the time of doing things. edison and the 1000 bulbs (or whatever). transformation: vibration into tension into heat into light. power applied. light from darkness.

the hunter's arrow: or just the arrow. the other is the vector. aim, goals, targets. but also hunting: how you finish something. the will made remote. the wand, associated. like a magic wand, but not magic. reaching and getting. (missing)

the house: again, shelter. ah, immovable: a place made (not really but ideally) forever into a separate space. home, that does not come with you. where you return to. where you keep your stuff. where you are comfortable - or not! maybe where you wish you could get away from.

the speech bubble: response. waiting for response? space made for response. speech, at least in potential. what you fill in, or rather, something to be filled in. deciding what to say. not saying. not being ready?

sleep: stepping out of the world, into nowhere, or into somewhere else. recovery. getting from one time to another, not by going through them, but by going away. turning inward, entirely. turning off. dreams, not the "i wish" kind but the morpheus kind.

the clock: four o'clock, in particular. how literally do we take the four o'clock part? it's hard to represent a general time with a static image of a clock. so it's just the clock: not time, but the representation of time, considering time, figuring out the time. waiting. meeting. scheduling. planning.
