# What is this all about, anyway?

I think about narrative a lot in various aspects, for instance

* stories-about-the-world as major determiners of what we can imagine and what we choose to do
* retelling the stories-of-our-lives as a tool of growth
* story-construction as the principal operation of divination

More practically, story-telling is central to:

* project management
* science
* friendship
* history (from the personal to the global, the subatomic to the universal)

Stories tell us what we believe, and why (and what we _don't_ believe, and why). Effective storytelling is powerful.

I've had a set of story cubes almost as long as I've known what they are - a decade or more, I think. I have toyed with them and I have treasured them but I have not really _used_ them. Lately I've been spending a lot of time thinking about developing a system for doing so. Now I'm working on _doing_ the development. At present my rough idea of what's involved in that looks more or less like

* characterize each face, with the image, taken literally, as an anchor, but elaborating into the abstract or fanciful etc. Explore the relationship between the concrete object represented by the image and its cloud of connotations.
* lay out a set of basic narrative arcs - maybe just one!? maybe several. probably not more than that.
* either add to each characterization a focused interpretation of it as each part of an arc ("actor", "obstacle", "goal", "distraction", hmm there will be a lot of these) or, now that I'm detailing this and realizing just how much that would involve, offer some examples of such an interpretation as a way of pointing towards a system that can be fleshed out as needed

Okay, grant that storytelling is powerful; still, why this? Here's one try: Because telling a really effective story depends on probing the structures you want to convey, shining different lights on them, seeking different angles. One way to do that is to project them onto unexpected frames.
